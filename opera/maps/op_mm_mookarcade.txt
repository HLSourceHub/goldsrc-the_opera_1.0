Name: Escape from the arcade!
Designer: Nick Cramer (drumdude)
Type: Opera Mookmatch
#Players: 1-4

Description:
Rival triad leader Fu Leng has captured you,
emptied your pockets, and imprisoned you in
his secret underground confinement located 
underneath the "GamePort" family entertainment
center that he owns. 

Looks like they forgot to check a few pockets. 

Break out of your cage, and escape through the
arcade. Show no mercy, even to the videogames.
