Description:
Welcome to the top floor of the Shimazu Industries 
building. This successful Japanese firm is well-known
for its top notch overseas shipping. The fact that it
is a Yakuza front is not so well-known. I hope you have 
an appointment as all the executives are currently in a 
top-level meeting.
