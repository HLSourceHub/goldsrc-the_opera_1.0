Map Name: Assign Retribution (Grento)
Designer: Mr Myre (Daniel Lawrence)
Type: Opera Mookmatch
Players: 1-2

The Setup:
Your brother is dead. Cut down ruthlessly by
your former employers the Lai Family as a
punishment for a failed drug run. Having
escaped from prison it's time to take your revenge. 

Some important members of the Lai family are
having a meeting on the top floor of a nearby
office block. I think you know what to do.

Tips:
- Take it slow and be cautious. A suprised mook is a dead mook.
- Remember your heroic acts and use them wisely.
- Enjoy yourself and try and maximise your score.
