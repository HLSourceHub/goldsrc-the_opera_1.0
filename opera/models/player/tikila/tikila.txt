INFO: This is a player model skin based off of Tom Dunne's Opera player model, suit2. 
It requires The Opera TC for Half-Life to operate and the latest Half-Life patch. 
This model is not for use with any other programs. It is not provided with stand alone 
support.

DESCRIPTION: Tikila is a maverick Hong Kong cop that never takes no for an answer 
and is never afraid to spill a little blood! Tikila is dressed in a black suit with 
a red shirt and a matching tie.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: This is a core model and is therefore included with The 
Opera. No fidgeting required...or suggested.

THANKS/MISC: Many thanks go out to Tom Dunne, without whom my dream of skinning a 
model like this would have never happened. To Dave Flor as well for setting up the 
code and getting the model functioning at all! God need thanks too, for without him, 
I would be a dead man after that whole VGUI/HUD thing...^_^
