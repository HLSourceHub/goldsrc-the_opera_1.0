INFO: This is a player model skin based off of Tom Dunne's Opera player 
model, trenchcoat. It requires The Opera TC for Half-Life to operate 
and the latest Half-Life patch. This model is not for use with any other 
programs. It is not provided with stand alone support.

DESCRIPTION: This is Sean, The Opera's premire character. This skin 
represents Sean as depicted in the Penthouse level for The Opera. The 
skin is an asain variant of the trenchcoat model with a white cotton 
shirt, blue jeans and The Opera's signature "Real World" trenchcoat. 
(I think it looks out of this world, but that is just me.)

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: This is a core model and is therefore included 
with The Opera. No fidgeting required... or suggested.

THANKS/MISC: Many thanks go out to Tom Dunne, without whom my dream of 
skinning a model like this would have never happened. To Dave Flor as 
well for setting up the code and getting the model functioning at all! 
God need thanks too, for without him, I would be a dead man after that 
whole VGUI/HUD thing... ^_^
