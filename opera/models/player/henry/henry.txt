INFO: This is a player model skin based off of Tom Dunne's Opera player model. It 
requires The Opera TC for Half-Life to operate and the latest Half-Life patch. 
This model is not for use with any other programs. It is not provided with stand 
alone support.

DESCRIPTION: Henry Li is a NYPD cop that has been fighting organized crime undercover 
for the past three years. The role of undercover investigator has blurred as he is 
called to be a Triad assassin. Henry is wearing a gray trenchcoat, blue button up 
shirt with white cotton unsershirt and a pair of white slacks.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: This is a core model and is therefore included with The 
Opera. No fidgeting required...or suggested.

THANKS/MISC: Many thanks go out to Tom Dunne, without whom my dream of skinning a 
model like this would have never happened. To Dave Flor as well for setting up the 
code and getting the model functioning at all! God need thanks too, for without him, 
I would be a dead man after that whole VGUI/HUD thing...^_^
