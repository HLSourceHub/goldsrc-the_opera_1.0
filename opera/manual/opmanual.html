      <h2><font color="#600000"><b><font color="88393C" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weng 
        knew he was in hell.</font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="88393C"> 
        He was just surprised at how quickly hell came, and how quiet it was. 
        </font> </h2>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The streets were absolutely 
        silent, even though he knew there were two others about-probably both 
        hiding, as he was. A wry smile passed over his face. Assassins do that 
        sort of thing: mentally prepare themselves before a battle for survival.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weng's hands passed over his 
        body as he thought, subconsciously checking his arsenal. Twin Berettas 
        tucked into his pants, by his back; a knife sheathed in his boot; and, 
        of course, the Desert Eagle in his hand. He passed the handgun to his 
        right hand, checking the weight, the balance. It was perfect, a well-crafted 
        piece of weaponry. Weng had worked hard for his weapons, the better to 
        stay alive. Assassins need weapons for survival.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those efforts would save his 
        life now, or be for naught.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wind howled, whipping his 
        trenchcoat about his body as he crouched. A silent curse echoed in Weng's 
        head&#151;that would make things difficult. The wind only made it harder 
        to hear the others. There definitely were others.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He sat there, in hell, waiting 
        for someone to be foolish enough to make the first move, when he saw something 
        land softly on the pavement before him. Weng narrowed his eyes&#151;the 
        thing almost blended into the pavement&#151;before he realised what it 
        was.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A black rose.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Instantly, two things popped 
        into his mind&#151;someone knew where he was, and, more importantly, someone 
        was taunting him <i>instead of firing</i>. Of course, assassins do that 
        sort of thing, too, but only among assassins&#151;a twisted sort of professional 
        courtesy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weng didn't have long to think, 
        though&#151;bullets started to cascade around him, shrapnel flying up 
        from the pavement. He dove underneath the car, crushing the rose with 
        his body as he slid to safety. The bullets smashed the windshields, the 
        glass falling inside the car and out, peppering the road with sharp points.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He cursed&#151;Weng was effectively 
        blind, and pinned, underneath the car. He turned his head, in enough time 
        to see his second adversary standing in an alleyway, smoking. The cloaked 
        man tossed the butt away, crushing the glowing stick under his boot, before 
        drawing his Uzi. A small fragment of asphault stung Weng's cheek, prompting 
        action. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weng rolled, kicking to a standing 
        position, and dashed with all the speed he could muster as the bullets 
        from above followed him in a line. He dove again, coming up behind a corner, 
        and squeezed a few shots at the smoker (the only gunman in sight). He 
        retaliated, spraying a few rounds in Weng's direction for his trouble. 
        The firing from above continued, taking chunks away from the wall behind 
        which Weng was standing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hell was rapidly becoming a 
        very loud, very dangerous place.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Uzi-toting smoker started 
        to back up, to look to the sky... he was trying to find the rooftop gunman. 
        Catching a glimpse of the man, he fired another spray, the distinct chatter 
        of an Uzi's automatic firing filling the night.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Taking advantage of the turned 
        back, Weng raised his Eagle and fired. As if guided by a guardian angel, 
        the smoking man turned slightly, only catching the round in the right 
        shoulder&#151;a move that saved his life. No sound escaped his lips but 
        for a slight grunt&#151;assassins don't scream in pain. The smoker whirled 
        and took aim at Weng, but with his arm wounded, the Uzi's rounds initially 
        went high... and just as they lowered, the click of an empty magazine 
        sounded. The smoker muttered a low curse.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The roof gunman returned to 
        his vantage point, sensing an advantage... but the Uzi swung back up. 
        Weng blinked: the smoker could reload faster than he had ever seen before, 
        even for an assassin. The smoker squeezed the trigger gently. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weng watched as a brilliant 
        flash burst from the Uzi's muzzle, almost straight up into the sky. The 
        weapons discharged its entire clip, advancing a wall of lead towards the 
        roof of the building. Concrete fell to the ground, shattering as they 
        it his the sidewalk. One bullet pierced the hunched-over figure on the 
        rooftop in the chest. A misguided spray of bullets rained from the roof, 
        but moments later, the figure pitched over a railing and landed on the 
        shot-out car under which Weng had first sought refuge. The metal complained 
        in a loud crash, and Weng could see that the man was dead. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Taking the offensive, Weng 
        threw his Eagle aside, not bothering to reload, and reached behind him, 
        to draw out his Berettas. Both levelled, taking aim at the smoking man&#133; 
        and Weng dove forward, firing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The smoker grunted again as 
        one bullet found its mark, and fired his Uzi again&#151;not remembering 
        that the clip was empty. Weng twisted his body nonetheless, dodging bullets 
        that never came, and rolled to a standing position.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The smoker's arms shot forward&#151;in 
        an instant, akimbo Beretta Tomcats sprung out into his hands. Weng didn't 
        even have time to blink as his opponent grinned, an assassin's razor-edge 
        smirk, and fired.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pain seared across his legs, 
        and Weng sucked in a shuddering breath. He hadn't felt the kiss of bullets 
        in a long while. He tried to step back, but every motion filled him with 
        agony&#133; before a sudden calm came over him. Weng realised that the 
        dance wasn't over, and his thoughts focused, the pain's spike becoming 
        a dull throbbing. He stepped forward, and started to run, the howling 
        wind only pushing him forward at a breakneck pace. The smoker blanched, 
        and fired again, but the bullets never seemed to find their mark.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Silently, one Beretta came 
        up, and at point blank range, Weng squeezed the trigger. He looked away, 
        not wanting to see the smoker's head disappear in a pink cloud.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weng dropped to his knees, 
        panting&#133; slowly setting the Berettas on the pavement. Hell was quiet 
        once more, the wind becoming the prevalent sound, instead of gunfire. 
        It was never easy to escape from such a life-threatening situation, and 
        Weng had succeeded&#133;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For an assassin, be it deathly 
        quiet or a roaring crescendo, Hell happens all the time&#133; and eventually, 
        the assassin will succumb. For Weng, like the others, is merely a player 
        on a stage. However, in this performance, actors are meant to die&#133;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The Opera</i> isn't about

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What <i>The Opera</i> IS about 
        is John Woo-style gunfights&#151;a recreation of an HKBO movie. Not a 
        fragfest: a <i>duel</i>. Learning how to live with getting killed by a 
        rocket launcher is easy. How about when your opponent double-taps you

      <h3><font color="680000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rolls</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can perform rolls by pressing 
        the Roll Key (Default: C) while holding down the direction you wish to 
        go. Your view will rotate while rolling.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note: You cannot roll backwards. 
        You also cannot roll if you have a <a href="#LongGun">Long Gun</a> equipped.</font></p>

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Double-tap the Strafe Keys (Defaults:

      <h3><font color="680000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dives</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Diving is performed much in 
        the same way as rolls are: press the Dive Key (Default: Right Mouse Button) 
        while holding down the direction you wish to go.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you tap the direction key 
        or the Dive Key again during a dive, you will either roll (if you are 
        diving forwards) or perform a cartwheel (if you are diving sideways). 
        You cannot roll if you have a <a href="#LongGun">Long Gun</a> equipped.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you dive backwards, or do 
        not press the Dive Key during your roll, you will slide along the ground. 
        Control your slide by holding down direction keys. To get up, press the 
        Move Backwards Key (Default: S or Down Arrow) or the Jump Key (Default: 
        Spacebar). If you dove forward, you can roll along the ground by pressing 
        the Sidestep Keys (Default: A, D, Left and Right Arrows).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Diving into someone will damage 
        them. As well, diving and lying prone will slightly improve your aim.</font></p>
      <h3><font color="680000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jumps</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can jump in the air by 
        pressing the Jump Key (Default: Spacebar).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can perform a somersault 
        in the air by pressing the Jump Key during your jump. This gives you extra 
        height. While in a somersault, it will be slightly harder for your opponents 
        to hit you. If you are close to a player, this will Jump Kick them instead.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can also perform a Wall 
        Jump by pressing the Jump Key when making contact with a wall in mid-jump. 
        This will push you up and away from the wall at a high speed.</font></p>
      <h3><font color="680000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kicks</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pressing the Use key (Default: 
        E) and the Dive Key (Default: Right Mouse Button)</font> will let you 
        kick out in front of you, when all other options have failed. </p>
      <h3><font color="680000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looting</font></h3>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have some time after wasting your 
      enemy? Press the Use Key (Default: E) while next to a corpse to loot his 
      body of some cash and some ammunition.</font> 
      <h3><font color="680000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Heroic Act</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you think it's all over 
        for the hero, think again. Press the Heroic Act Key (Default: X) to perform 
        a Heroic Act. It costs a large chunk of your Action Meter. It gives you 
        a slight boost in speed, a slight amount of healing, and other benefits 
        befitting a hero. However, once you perform a Heroic Act, you must wait 
        a while before you can muster up the courage, determination, and spirit 
        required for another one.</font></p>

      <h2><font color="#600000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#88393C">His 
        name was Paladin.</font></b></font> </h2>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The name became a joke, in 
        some circles&#133; something akin to a story designed to scare children 
        into being good. &quot;Careful. Paladin'll get ya.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a code of ethics, 
        among assassins, strangely enough. There are rules of engagement; those 
        who violate them don't get reprimanded. They get to deal with Paladin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weng didn't believe that Paladin 
        actually existed; the stories were simply too fantastic. He would have 
        been surprised to learn, then, that Paladin was watching him from a second-floor 
        window, and it was Paladin who had thrown the black rose that prompted 
        the duel.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paladin frowned, looking at 
        the wreckage left behind from the firefight. The rooftop gunman still 
        lay on the car, the smoking assassin beside it. It was disgusting, really. 
        No honour. They were more concerned with their impressive firepower. They 
        weren't in it for the rush, the slight bitter taste of adrenaline in the 
        throat&#133; they were in it for the guns. For the money.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He popped a pill into his mouth 
        and swallowed it-diazepam. It was an assassin's secret; adrenaline kept 
        you alive, but it also played hell with your aim.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The threaded cylinders were 
        lying on the desk beside him; Paladin picked them up and slowly screwed 
        them into his Walther PPK pistols. He watched the Weng's crouched figure 
        suck in breaths for a short time, and then readied himself. It was time 
        for Weng to dance again.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A second black rose fell to 
        the pavement at Weng's feet; he glanced about, instantly on his guard 
        again. The fatigue that seemed all-consuming only moments ago fell away 
        from him as he picked up his Berettas once more. Weng knew that there 
        was something different happening now; this would be a true duel, one 
        worthy of repeating.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One worthy to join the other 
        stories that circulated about Paladin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Paladin was sure that 
        his opponent was prepared, he dove out of the window, his suppressed pistols 
        letting out muted yelps as he shot thrice. Weng heard one bullet sizzle 
        close, almost too close, to his right ear; the other two made a dull clanging 
        noise as they hit the Berettas in his hands, denting their barrels.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weng was too surprised to even 
        move as he watched Paladin hit the pavement with his shoulder, rolling 
        with absolute silence. The moment of hesitation cost him, as he found 
        his legs kicked out from under him. Weng did have the presence of mind 
        to toss his useless pistols away, however. He rolled, until he hit the 
        corpse of the smoking man; he pushed up with his hands into a cartwheel, 
        grabbing the fallen man's Uzi in the process.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paladin got up from the kick, 
        his back to Weng, and walked slowly away, his trenchcoat flaring in the 
        wind.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weng remembered that the Uzi 
        had no ammunition left, and so stooped, reaching out blindly for a spare 
        magazine; he found one, amazingly, and slammed it into the gun.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hearing Weng reload the Uzi 
        prompted Paladin to spin, his coat swirling about him&#133; and that's 
        when Weng looked his attacker in the face for the first time. They both 
        stood there a moment, looking at each other&#133; a fury rising between 
        them, but at the same time the strange mutual respect and admiration among 
        assassins.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The moment was short-lived.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paladin started to walk back, 
        slowly, his guns held low. The Uzi flared in the night once more as Weng 
        spewed bullets in Paladin's general direction; as if he intimidated the 
        bullets themselves, none found their mark.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weng panicked, ran forwards, 
        and emptied the remaining bullets in the magazine, but to no avail. Paladin 
        simply stood there, watching the younger man.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He knew it was over; Weng dropped 
        the Uzi and ran.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paladin shook his head, raised 
        one PPK, and fired it twice. Weng stumbled, both of his legs crippled, 
        and fell beside the car.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other PPK came up, another 
        two shots fired, directly into the smashed car's gas tank. Weng and the 
        two corpses were consumed by the ensuing explosion. The walls of the surrounding 
        buildings became scorched by the fire, and the asphalt grew soft.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paladin always tried to clean 
        up all the loose ends in his battles; the explosion, while a little too 
        loud for his tastes, did quite nicely. He kicked the dropped Uzi towards 
        the fire, finishing the job.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Except for the second black 
        rose, of course.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Legends have to leave their 
        calling card, after all.</font><br>
